> The latest Publish Tool version `1.20.0` is releasedüéâ, potentially one of the most revolutionary iterations since the
> inception of first releasesüëÄ.

- Notable inclusions within version `1.20.0` comprise the introduction of additional publishing platforms, an initial
  foray into supporting the docker version, along with enhancements tailored to optimize user interactions.

    - The prominent features integrated into `1.20.0` encompass:

        - #958 #1009 Experimental support for the docker edition of siyuan-note, marking a preliminary step towards its
          implementation. Should anomalies surface during deployment, the extension welcomes the addition of GitHub
          issues for resolution.
            - **Please note: Unavailability of CORS proxy configuration will render the functionality inactive!!!**
            - The image feature of the Picgo plugin is currently unavailable in the Docker version; support will be
              introduced in 1.20.1.
        - #1053 Introduction of the publishing platform telegra.ph
            - **Please note: Unavailability of CORS proxy configuration will render the functionality inactive!!!
              Furthermore, accessing article previews mandates circumventing restrictions via appropriate means.**
            - For discussions on CORS proxy complications or other inquiries, feel free to engage in group discussions
              or reach out to the author at youweics@163.com
            - At present, only anonymous posting and updates are supported; login functionality will be incorporated in
              version 1.20.1.
        - #1054 Addition of article management capabilities
            - Renamed article management as Dashboard. Feedback regarding nomenclature adjustments can be deliberated
              via issues, facilitating responsive modifications by the author.
            - Facilitation of displaying all platform publication icons
            - Provision for exhibiting the count of publishing platforms
            - Integration of filters for curated published articles

    - `1.20.0` predominantly refines the following areas of focus:

        - Incorporation of development documentation alongside a preview of forthcoming version agendas
        - Enhanced Plugin Store experience
        - Streamlined import processes, now accommodating customized imports
        - Exquisitely refined iteration of `sy-post-publisher widget

    - Furthermore, post the `1.14.0` version, the author discretely developed an import function. Users can swiftly
      import built-in platforms through `Settings` -> `Publish Settings` -> `Import Platforms` feature üòÑ

## FAQ

* Q1ÔºöHow to install the publishing tool plugin? Where can I find his entrance after installation?

  A1ÔºöFind **`Bazaar->Plugins->Publishing Tools`** to download and enable.

  The installation process requires no further action. This is no different from the download and installation of other
  plugins.

  After the installation is complete, find the ‚úàÔ∏è icon on the top right toolbar, click the menu, and follow the
  corresponding instructions to use it.


* Q2ÔºöAfter installing the publishing tool plugin, do I still need to install the widget?

  A2Ôºö**unnecessary.**

  The plugin version contains all the functions of the widget version.

* Q3: I am not used to the new version of the operation and want to continue to use the previous widget, can I?

  A3:**Yes but not recommended.**

  **We strongly recommend that you use the plug-in version directly, because the plug-in version will be the main
  version for long-term maintenance in the future, and the hanger version has been deprecated only as a fix for problems
  and compatible with historical users.**


* Q4ÔºöI used to use `Custom JS Fragment` or add `WidgetInvoke` directly, do I still need to download the plugin now?

  A4Ôºö**Optional.** But we highly recommended to remove JS snippets and widgets to download the plugin version.

  If you don't want to use the plugin version, you don't need to download it, just use the original `custom JS fragment`
  or add `widget` to continue using.

  If you want to use the plugin version, then we strongly recommend that you delete the previously
  added `custom JS snippets` and `widgets`, download the plugin version directly, and enable it. No other additional
  action is required.


* Q5ÔºöIs it possible to migrate my historical configuration data items to the plugin?

* A5Ôºö**Yes.**

  Please go to `Settings->Import and Export->Import the historical data of the widget version. ` Operation.

  Note: The widget version configuration data import only supports `sy-p-cfg-v0.8.0.json` and `picgo.json`.


* Q6ÔºöWhat should I do if the platform I need to publish is not provided by the publishing tool?
