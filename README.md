# Publisher

![](./icon.png)

Publish articles from siyuan-note to platforms such as Yuque, Notion, Cnblogs, WordPress, Typecho, Hexo, Zhihu and more.

Support features such as fast publishing, image bed management, platform expansion, smart labels, etc.

> 🎉 I am pleased to announce the `1.14.0` release of Publish Tool.

  - In this update, we have added several new platforms, including JianShu, Juejin, as well as Hugo, Jekyll, Vuepress, Vuepress2, and Vitepress. The latter platforms are also compatible with both `Github` and `Gitlab`. 
  - Oh, and in this version, the author secretly developed an import feature. You can quickly import predefined platforms using the `Settings` -> `Publish Settings` -> `Import Predefined Platforms` function 😄

> Platform Limitations:
  - **WeChat Official Accounts**: Publishing Tool now supports posting articles to the WeChat Official Accounts draft box in version `1.13.0` and beyond. However, due to limitations on the WeChat platform in Electron, normal login operations are not possible. Therefore, you will need to visit `https://mp.weixin.qq.com/` yourself, complete the login, copy the cookie, and then paste it into the configuration options.
  - **Notion**: Since Notion is block-based, not a whole document, it is constrained by technology and does not support updates. To update, you can only delete and then repost it.
  - **Juejin**: Due to the mandatory requirements of the Jujin platform, tags and classifications must be filled in, if you do not select publishing, a backend classification and programmer label will be added by default, otherwise you will not be able to publish.
  - **Juejin**: **Juejin need to review every time they publish an article**, so the preview may be 404 immediately after publishing the article, at which point you can modify the link '/post' to '/spost' for temporary viewing, or wait patiently for the review to pass.

## FAQ

* Q1：How to install the publishing tool plugin? Where can I find his entrance after installation?

  A1：Find **`Bazaar->Plugins->Publishing Tools`** to download and enable.

  The installation process requires no further action. This is no different from the download and installation of other plugins.

  After the installation is complete, find the ✈️ icon on the top right toolbar, click the menu, and follow the corresponding instructions to use it.


* Q2：After installing the publishing tool plugin, do I still need to install the widget?

  A2：**unnecessary.**

  The plugin version contains all the functions of the widget version.

* Q3: I am not used to the new version of the operation and want to continue to use the previous widget, can I?

  A3:**Yes but not recommended.**

  **We strongly recommend that you use the plug-in version directly, because the plug-in version will be the main version for long-term maintenance in the future, and the hanger version has been deprecated only as a fix for problems and compatible with historical users.**


* Q4：I used to use `Custom JS Fragment` or add `WidgetInvoke` directly, do I still need to download the plugin now?

  A4：**Optional.** But we highly recommended to remove JS snippets and widgets to download the plugin version.

  If you don't want to use the plugin version, you don't need to download it, just use the original `custom JS fragment` or add `widget` to continue using.

  If you want to use the plugin version, then we strongly recommend that you delete the previously added `custom JS snippets` and `widgets`, download the plugin version directly, and enable it. No other additional action is required.


* Q5：Is it possible to migrate my historical configuration data items to the plugin?

* A5：**Yes.**

  Please go to `Settings->Import and Export->Import the historical data of the widget version. ` Operation.
